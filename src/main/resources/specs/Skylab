Skylab
======

Skylab was a space station launched and operated by NASA and was the United 
States' first space station. Skylab orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979, and 
included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. It was launched 
unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of 170,000 pounds 
(77,111 kg).[1] Three manned expeditions to the station, conducted between 
May 1973 and February 1974 using the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) atop 
the smaller Saturn IB, each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the last two 
manned missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the 
crew in orbit if it was needed.

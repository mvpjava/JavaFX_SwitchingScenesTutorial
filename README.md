# JavaFX_SwitchingScenesTutorial

JavaFX State Manager inetegrated with Spring Framework supporting Scene Swapping

The design incorporates the use of a Stage Manager which, with the help of the Spring Framework will allow you to dependency inject it anywhere into your code base and request a Scene swap.

The example demonstrated how to switch from the Login Scene to the Main application Scene however the architecture allows you to scale to as many Scenes as you want without having  to copy paste your code everywhere like is shown in other tutorials. 

Simply put, after this tutorial you'll be switching Scenes like a boss!
